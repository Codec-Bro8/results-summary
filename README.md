## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- desktop-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
:root {
  --main-color: blue;
}
.div{
  color: var(--main-color);
}

this works in holding any css property.
```

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

would be adding some JS to give it that dynamic vibe.
